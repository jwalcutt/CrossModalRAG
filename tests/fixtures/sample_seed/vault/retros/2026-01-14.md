# Retrieval Smoke Test Retro (Synthetic)

## What Worked

The lexical retriever returned the project planning note and the latest commit summary.

## Issue Observed

Ranking placed an older setup note above the commit that documented the seeding command scaffold.

## Follow-up

Track this query in `queries_eval` so ranking changes can be measured.
